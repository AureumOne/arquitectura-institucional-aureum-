## Purpose

* functional expansion
* commercial pressure-induced deviation

This document supersedes narrative, intent or interpretation.

## Nature of the Document

* Literal legal charter
* Non-promotional
* Non-executive
* Non-negotiable

It defines **what Aureum One can never become**, regardless of jurisdiction, demand or growth.

---

## Core Lock Principles

Aureum One is structurally prohibited from:

* asset custody
* discretionary asset management
* intermediation of investments
* issuance of financial instruments
* performance-linked remuneration
* assumption of fiduciary duties

These prohibitions are **architectural**, not policy-based.

## Amendment Rule

The Legal Boundary Lock:

* cannot be amended by management
* cannot be amended by commercial decision
* may only be amended through a formal, documented governance process

Any amendment constitutes a **structural event**, not an operational one.
