# Negative Scope & Prohibited Activities

## Purpose

Risk clarity is achieved more by what is excluded than by what is permitted.

This document defines the **non-negotiable negative scope**.

---

## Prohibited Activities (Non-Exhaustive)

Aureum One will never:

* custody assets
* intermediate investments
* issue tokens as financial instruments
* provide leverage
* offer yield or performance expectations
* override custodial records
* accept discretionary exceptions

---

## No-Exception Principle

No commercial opportunity, client request or jurisdictional argument may justify deviation.

Scope integrity takes precedence over growth.
