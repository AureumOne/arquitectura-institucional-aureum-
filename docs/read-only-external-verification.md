# Read-Only External Verification Model

## Purpose

This document defines how third-party verification is permitted without compromising neutrality.

---

## Verification Constraints

External reviewers:

* have read-only access
* cannot generate events
* cannot alter records
* cannot "validate" the system

Their output represents **their interpretation**, not system truth.

---

## Non-Substitution Principle

External review:

* does not replace evidence
* does not become a source of truth
* does not bind Aureum One

Verification is optional.
Evidence is not.
