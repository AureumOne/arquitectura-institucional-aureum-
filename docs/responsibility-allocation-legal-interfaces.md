# Responsibility Allocation & Legal Interfaces

## Purpose

This document provides a **formal legal mapping** of responsibility boundaries.

It exists to protect:

* directors
* governance actors
* country managers
* auditors

---

## Allocation Model

* Aureum One → governance, coordination, evidence
* Custodian → physical custody & safekeeping
* Execution Venue → trade execution
* Asset Holder → economic exposure
* Auditor → interpretation only

No actor inherits responsibility from another by proximity or interaction.

---

## Interface Risk Control

Where responsibilities touch:

* interfaces are explicit
* assumptions are documented
* no implied duty exists

Legal responsibility remains **layer-bound**.
