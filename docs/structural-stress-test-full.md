# Structural Stress Test — Full Adversarial Review

## Purpose

This document exists to expose failure, not to prevent it.

It does not aim to reassure, promote or validate the system.
Its sole purpose is to describe **what happens when assumptions fail**, boundaries are tested and pressure is applied.

This material is intended for:

* risk committees
* auditors
* institutional counterparties
* adversarial reviewers

---

## Scope

This review evaluates **architecture**, not operations.

Specifically:

* authority boundaries
* segregation of roles
* evidence integrity
* failure containment

It does **not** evaluate:

* commercial viability
* regulatory approvals
* counterparty behavior
* asset safety guarantees

---

## Core Premise

Aureum One does not attempt to eliminate risk.
It attempts to **expose risk without obscuring it**.

Failure is not corrected.
Failure is **recorded, surfaced and contained**.

---

## Failure Philosophy

* No silent correction exists
* No retroactive adjustment is permitted
* No human authority may override recorded evidence

Resolution occurs **only through new events**, never by rewriting history.

No assurances are made.
