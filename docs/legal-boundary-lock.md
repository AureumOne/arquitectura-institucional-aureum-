# Legal Boundary Lock — Executive View

## Purpose

This document explains **what is structurally impossible**, not merely prohibited.

It is an **explanatory abstraction** of the Legal Boundary Lock, not its literal form.

---

## Structural Impossibility vs Policy

Aureum One does not rely on policy to remain compliant.

Instead:

* activities outside scope are **architecturally unreachable**
* system design prevents functional expansion into regulated domains

---

## Examples of Structurally Blocked Activities

* Custody of assets
* Control of client accounts
* Issuance of financial instruments
* Discretionary investment decisions
* Promises of return or yield

These are not "not allowed".
They are **not possible** within the system's design.

## Reference

A full Legal Boundary Lock exists in literal form and is available **only under controlled distribution**.
