# Structural Stress Test (Adversarial Review)

## Reading Instruction

This document is designed **to be attacked**, not trusted.

It evaluates:

* failure modes
* authority boundaries
* evidence integrity
* governance limits

It does **not** evaluate:

* commercial viability
* regulatory approval
* counterparty behavior
* asset safety guarantees

The purpose is to expose **what happens when things fail**, not to claim that they will not.

No assurances are made.
