# Jurisdictional Neutrality & Enforcement Limits

## Purpose

This document addresses a common misinterpretation:
that Aureum One operates through regulatory arbitrage.

It does not.

---

## Architecture Precedes Jurisdiction

The legal nature of Aureum One is defined by **function**, not geography.

Operating the same architecture elsewhere does not change its classification.

Technology does not constitute a jurisdiction.

---

## Explicit Limits

Aureum One:

* does not replace courts
* does not enforce contracts
* does not resolve disputes

All enforcement remains external:

* custodial agreements
* execution contracts
* applicable law

The system exposes facts; it does not adjudicate them.

> **Risk is not eliminated.
> It is made visible, bounded and non-transferable.**
