# AIEL Boundary Lock — Evidence as the Only Source of Truth

## Purpose

This document defines the **non-negotiable evidentiary boundary** of the Aureum One system.

Within Aureum One:

* an event **without evidence does not exist**
* an action **without a recorded event has no institutional standing**

Evidence is not supporting material.
Evidence is the **primary object**.

---

## Core Principle

Aureum One does not operate on:

* representations
* attestations of intent
* opinions
* reconciliations by assertion

The system operates exclusively on **primary, immutable evidence generated at the moment of action**.

If evidence is absent, the system treats the event as non-existent.

---

## Boundary Enforcement

No actor — including governance — may:

* introduce events retroactively
* modify recorded evidence
* override evidence via decision

Authority is forward-only.
History is immutable.
