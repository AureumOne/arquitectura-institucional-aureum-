# Capacity, Scale & Structural Limits Memo

## Purpose

This document defines **how far the system is designed to scale — and where it must stop**.

It exists to prevent:

* uncontrolled growth
* systemic overload
* risk dilution

---

## Capacity Philosophy

Aureum One is not designed for:

* infinite scale
* retail volume
* high-frequency activity

Capacity is constrained by:

* governance throughput
* reconciliation integrity
* auditability requirements

---

## Growth Discipline

Growth is:

* deliberate
* institutionally paced
* reversible

Exceeding capacity is treated as **risk**, not success.
