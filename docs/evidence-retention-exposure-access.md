# Evidence Retention, Exposure & Access Boundaries

## Purpose

This document defines **who can see what**, and why.

Transparency is **contextual**, not total.

---

## Access Model

* Asset holders see evidence related to their assets
* Governance sees evidence related to authorization
* Auditors see evidence relevant to their scope

There is:

* no global visibility
* no cross-client exposure
* no commercial access to evidentiary layers

---

## Retention Principle

Evidence is retained according to:

* institutional necessity
* audit requirements
* legal constraints

Records are not removed for convenience or reputation.

---

> **Evidence does not persuade.
> It persists.**
