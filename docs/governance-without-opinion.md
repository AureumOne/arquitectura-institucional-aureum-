# Governance Without Opinion

## Purpose

This document clarifies the **non-interpretive role of governance**.

Governance exists to authorize actions, **not to validate reality**.

---

## What Governance Does

* Authorizes sensitive actions
* Enforces rule thresholds
* Records decisions immutably
* Preserves traceability

---

## What Governance Never Does

* Certify asset sufficiency
* Validate custody integrity
* Assert factual truth
* Replace evidence

Governance decisions are **not sources of truth**.
They are **sources of authorization**.

Truth derives exclusively from **primary evidence**, not from human judgment.

---

## Why This Matters

Separating authority from truth:

* reduces fiduciary risk
* prevents conflict of interest
* eliminates opinion-based validation

Governance cannot override evidence — even under pressure.
