# Liability & Responsibility Segregation Statement

## Purpose

This document defines **who is responsible — and who explicitly is not**.

Its objective is to prevent:

* implicit fiduciary assumptions
* responsibility creep
* personal exposure of governance actors

---

## Role Separation

**Aureum One**

* Provides governance rules, coordination and evidence
* Does **not** custody assets
* Does **not** execute trades
* Does **not** guarantee outcomes

**Custodian**

* Holds physical gold
* Maintains legal custody
* Responds for asset existence and safekeeping

**Execution Venue**

* Executes trades under its own controls
* Responds for execution accuracy

**Client / Asset Holder**

* Retains ownership
* Bears economic exposure

**Auditor / Reviewer**

* Operates strictly read-only
* Produces independent interpretation
* Assumes no operational responsibility

---

## Explicit Exclusions

Aureum One assumes:

* no fiduciary duty
* no duty of result
* no duty of asset protection
* no duty of performance

Responsibility is **segregated by design**, not allocated by agreement.
