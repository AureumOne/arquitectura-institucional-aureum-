# Contractual Architecture & Agreements Matrix

## Purpose

This document defines **how contracts relate to the architecture**, not to operations.

It prevents:

* implicit obligations
* contractual overlap
* responsibility ambiguity

---

## Contractual Philosophy

Contracts do not create authority.
They **mirror structural separation**.

No contract may:

* consolidate custody and governance
* introduce discretionary authority
* create hidden fiduciary exposure

---

## Contract Types (Canonical)

* Governance & Infrastructure Agreement
* Custody Agreement (third-party)
* Execution Agreement (third-party)
* Client Participation Agreement
* Auditor / Reviewer Access Agreement

Each contract:

* is role-specific
* non-overlapping
* independently enforceable

---

## Explicit Exclusions

No contract:

* guarantees asset existence
* guarantees performance
* transfers liability between layers

Contracts align with architecture; they do not redefine it.
