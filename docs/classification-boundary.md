# Classification & Boundary Statement

*(S3.1 — Executive Abstract)*

## Legal Classification

Aureum One operates as:

* **B2B institutional infrastructure**
* **commodity-related (physical gold)**
* **non-financial**
* **non-custodial**
* **non-intermediating**

It does **not** constitute:

* a financial product
* a financial service provider
* an investment platform
* a broker, dealer or custodian

Revenue derives exclusively from **flat infrastructure and governance fees**, not from asset performance, trading activity or price movements.

---

## Boundary Enforcement

The system is architected to **prevent scope expansion** into regulated financial activities.

Any activity requiring:

* custody of assets
* discretionary investment decisions
* issuance of financial instruments
* promises of return

is **structurally impossible by design**, not merely prohibited by policy.
