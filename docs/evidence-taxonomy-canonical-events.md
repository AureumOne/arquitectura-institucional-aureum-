# Evidence Taxonomy & Canonical Event Types

## Purpose

This document defines **what constitutes evidence** and what does not.

Only events explicitly defined in the canonical taxonomy are recognized by the system.

---

## Canonical Evidence Categories

Evidence is generated exclusively within the following categories:

* **Governance Approvals**
* **Order Lifecycle Events**
* **Custody Confirmations (external references)**
* **Reconciliation States**
* **Incident & Exception Events**
* **System & Integrity Events**

Each category:

* audit-scoped
* semantically bounded
* non-interpretive

---

## What Evidence Is Not

The following are **explicitly not evidence**:

* explanations
* emails
* opinions
* summaries
* reports produced outside the system

Such materials may exist externally, but they have **no evidentiary authority** within Aureum One.
